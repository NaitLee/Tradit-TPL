# Tradit-TPL

*Use an HFS 2 'template' in HFS 3* - PRE-ALPHA stage

Dev branch of incoming features & changes, see issue #4

At the moment the functionality is the same as `main`, except there's i18n support.

`dist` is not provided, but in case you are interested, follow `main` readme to build. And build HFS from newest commit to use with.

There are messy WIP/test code parts, that don't work yet, and may be modified or removed at any time.

Don't pay too much attention as for now...

Yawn... Bed time...
