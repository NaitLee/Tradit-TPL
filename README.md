# Tradit-TPL

*Use an HFS 2 'template' in HFS 3* - PRE-ALPHA stage

----

Dev branch of incoming features & changes, see issue #4

At the moment the functionality is the same as `main`, except there's i18n support.

# Development

`dist` is not yet provided, but in case you are interested, build it:

0. clone repo, install Node.js 16+ if not present
1. `npm install`
2. `./9-release.sh` (on Windows please adapt the commands inside manually)

It's recommended to use `./8-debug.sh` though, and use folder `debug` in place of `dist`, in development.

And then build HFS from newest commit to use with.

----

There are messy WIP/test code parts, that don't work yet, and may be modified or removed at any time.

Don't pay too much attention as for now...

Yawn... Bed time...
